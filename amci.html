                The Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation (AMCI) was created in 1986 to 
                help strengthen the International Cooperation of the Kingdom of Morocco, with
                a strong orientation for the promotion of South-South Cooperation advocated by 
                His Majesty King Mohammed VI.<br> AMCI's mission is to develop cooperation
                between people and partners by contributing to the expansion and strengthening 
                of cultural, scientific, economic and technical cooperation between the Kingdom 
                of Morocco and the countries to which it has friendship ties and cooperation.<br>
                  AMCI acts in close coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International 
                  Cooperation in the implementation of actions carried out in partnership with the various
                    Moroccan ministerial departments and the partner countries concerned.<br>
                      The Agency's ambition is to be a major player in the implementation of South-South 
                      cooperation of the Kingdom of Morocco, by using the know-how and expertise of the Kingdom of Morocco in several areas to provide a support to developing countries, mainly in Africa.

              <p class="r5">
                AMCI offers scholarships/grants to foreign students in accordance
                with the procedures set out in the scholarship regulations; a copy 
                of which (attestation de bourse) is made available to the students concerned.<br>
                  AMCI grants are awarded annually within the framework of cooperation agreements
                    between the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco and the Governments of brotherly
                    and friendly countries; as part of the Moroccan scholarship offer notified to beneficiary
                      countries.<br>
                        The grant is awarded to the student holding, at least, a 
                      baccalaureate (high school certificate) or a recognized equivalent diploma, 
                      to pursue a higher studies cycle or professional training, in a Moroccan public university.
                      <br>
                      The scholarship is only a supplementary grant and therefore does not in any case include the payment of registration, boarding, transport or any other charges inherent in the pursuit of studies; these remain the responsibility of the student.

                With French being the lingua franca in Moroccan higher educational institutions, it is imperative to take a six-month preparatory course in basic French during your first year in Morocco as a new and non-French-speaking student.<br> <br>
                The International Centre for Languages (Centre International des langues, CIL) is a structure directly subordinate to AMCI, created in 2011 in response to strong regular demand from non-French-speaking partner countries, who wish to offer their students in Morocco, the possibility of an upgrade in the French language.<br><br>
                Since the creation of CIL, hundblues of non-French-speaking students have thus benefited from a language course supervised and taught in the best conditions by qualified teachers and according to a specialized educational program.<br><br>
                These sessions usually take place from January to June, during which students are usually accommodated at the International Students Hostel (CitÃ© Universitaire International, CUI). At the end of the year, students who successfully complete the course receive a certificate of approval with qualification for the pursuit of higher education in Morocco.<br><br>
                Installed in a green and conducive environment to pleasant learning, CIL offers specific and thematic courses in Moroccan dialect (Darija) for all students, with the aim of offering them daily communication tools geablue towards facilitating their adaptation and familiarization with their new environment.
